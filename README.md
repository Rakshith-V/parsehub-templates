# parsehub-templates
Ready made Parsehub templates for popular sites like flipkart and amazon

Parsehub: https://www.parsehub.com/
ParseHub is a scraping tool that is designed to work on websites with JavaScript and Ajax; it is similar to web scraping tools such as Import.io and Kimono Labs

*You will need to download the parsehub application on your computer to use the templates*

These files are of the ".phj" extension type.This extension is native to the Parsehub's application files and all the templates created/saved are saved in the ".phj" format.
You will need to open parsehub and import these files to get the ready made template to scrap mobile data from flipkart's phone section.
You can then run the template and collect data in the desired JSON/CSV/Excel format.


Happy Scraping!!!
